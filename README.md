Module 13: ORM

![Image of Just-Tech-News Home](screenshot.png)


## Purpose
Build the back end for my first completely full-stack application, Just Tech News—a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. 
Use Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify my MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connect my application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku. 

## Built With
* JawsDB Add-On
* Heroku
* Sequalize
* Dotenv
* bcrypt
* Git Hub
